        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>Writing Intern</h3>
        <h4>Bergen Record</h4>
        <h5>May-Aug 2024</h5>
        <p>
            I drafted articles covering local news, environmental information, and profiles. To produce stories, I
            conducted interviews with sources to gather information and quotes for stories and edited/revised content to
            meet deadlines. I published online and in print articles, filmed and edited man-on-the-street videos posted
            on social media platforms, helped the broadcast team livestream the Bergen County Football All-Star Game,
            and sat in on weekly editorial meetings to pitch and discuss story ideas.
        </p>

        <h3>Reporter/Anchor</h3>
        <h4>Terrapin Sports Central</h4>
        <h5>Aug 2022- Present</h5>
        <p>
            I report and anchor for Terrapin Sports Central, a student sports news service on campus. For reporting, I
            attend numerous Maryland sports games where I film, interview, and edit to create gamers posted on social
            media. On camera, I anchor “live” shows where I write my script, recap the prior week in Maryland sports,
            speak to guests, and play games behind the desk.
        </p>

        <h3>Entrepreneurship Intern</h3>
        <h4>Hilton Head Bicycle Company</h4>
        <h5>May-Aug 2023</h5>
        <p>
            I executed the delivery and collection of bicycles across properties on Hilton Head Island. I also
            participated in and completed a comprehensive 10-week Entrepreneurship program. Lastly, I leveraged real
            financial reports to gain practical knowledge about business valuation.
        </p>

        <h3>Counselor</h3>
        <h4>Panthers All Sports Camp</h4>
        <h5>Jun-Aug 2019, 2021, 2022</h5>
        <p>
            I served as a counselor while participating with kids in daily sports activities. I exercised final
            authority for assigned groups and created a safe environment for all children.
